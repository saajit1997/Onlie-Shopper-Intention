# Onlie-Shopper-Intention
Online shopping is growing rapidly day by day and has proven to be vital during the coronavirus pandemic as most physical stores were forced to be shut due to the lockdown restrictions imposed by nations globally. Businesses had to be swift and quickly adapt to selling their goods and services on online platforms and as a result there has been a huge surge in consumers shopping online. However, a big problem almost all businesses face when using online stores, is the ability to obtain a decent sales conversion rate of the users who view their sites. To tackle this issue, we are going to use machine learning to predict if customer will make a purchase or not by using usersâ€™ activity as parameters for the machine learning algorithms. The aim of this study is to identify possible recommendations a business can use to increase its conversion rate. The dataset was obtained from the UCI repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset).
